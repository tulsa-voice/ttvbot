								<h2>best NEW BAR</h2>
								<h3>Lefty’s on Greenwood</h3>
								<p>Lefty’s four-page drink menu features 15 beers on tap ranging from 3.2% abv to 14%, a strong top shelf of spirits, weekend brunch, daily happy hours, and a variety of frozen margarita flavors and popular drinks like the Peach Mule.</p>
								<p>The walls are lined with dozens of framed records from local favorites like J.J. Cale, J.D. McPherson, Parker Millsap, and The GAP Band, alongside an array of vintage liquor advertising mirrors. The quirky, pseudo-sports bar aesthetic, bathed in a plethora of natural light, welcomes fans who want to watch the game (eight televisions, mostly near the bar) without alienating those who just want to unwind with friends or listen to the bar’s near-daily live music. It’s a hodge-podge of styles made singular; no wonder Lefty’s is Tulsa’s favorite new watering hole.</p>

										<h3>The&nbsp;Chalkboard at the&nbsp;Ambassador</h3>
										<p>The Chalkboard doesn’t rest on its location laurels. It’s been around for 40-plus years but received a drastic makeover in 1999. Since then, it’s maintained a reputation as one of Tulsa’s very best restaurants. The sophisticated, world-class
											menu and upscale-but-unfussy atmosphere make it a dining destination, whether or not you’re staying at the adjoining Ambassador Hotel.</p>
										<p>Colorado rack of lamb, diver scallops, beef Wellington, Peking duck breast roulade, and small plates like crab cakes, grilled lamb lollipop with baba ganouj, chilled foie gras torchon and prime beef carpaccio with capers, lemon, parmesan and
											Makaron olive oil are just a few of the items that contribute to The Chalkboard’s sterling name. On the front-of-house side, the restaurant boasts a fantastic wine and cocktail list (the Chilantro—try it), and some of the most consistent service
											in Tulsa.</p>

										<h3>Phat&nbsp;Philly from Phat&nbsp;Philly’s</h3>
										<p>The online menu reads “Got the munchies? We’re open till 4 a.m. on Fridays &amp; Saturdays!” Yes, you do have the munchies. You check the time, punch the air victoriously and order an Uber. Messy visions of meat glistening with a sheen of cheese
											whiz, sautéed peppers and onions plague your mind on the ride over until, behold, you glimpse the yellow awning of this shrine to sandwich satiation known as Phat Philly’s. Approaching the counter with an almost spiritual reverence, the menu’s
											simplicity offers a universal message: cheesesteak. Gooey, glorious, Philadelphia-style cheesesteak, which you order with a childlike grin. You don’t need waffle fries, but you order those, too.</p>

										<h2>Best COFFEE HOUSE</h2>
										<h3>The Coffee House on Cherry&nbsp;Street</h3>
										<p>After you’ve picked out your produce at Tulsa’s favorite farmers’ market, grab a seat next to the fireplace at Tulsa’s favorite coffee house, located just around the corner at 15th and Rockford.</p>
										<p>The Coffee House on Cherry Street—known affectionately by locals as “CHOCS”—is a haven for hot drinks (they pour Doubleshot coffee, exclusively), simple, fresh breakfast and lunch fare, and over-the-top cakes and desserts. Try the hyperlocal
											Sunrise (Fisher Farm eggs, pancakes made with LOMAH dairy, Farrell Family bread and local sausage or bacon), key lime pie, or grab one of CHOCS’ many gluten-free or vegan treats (the pumpkin muffin is supreme).</p>
										<p>CHOCS even has its own mobile app with specials and updates, perfect for die-hard coffee lovers. Just be warned: at peak hours, this coffeehouse’s overwhelming popularity translates into frequently long lines. Plan accordingly.</p>

										<h3>Lanna Thai</h3>
										<p>Ask any Tulsan for Thai food recommendations and Lanna Thai is bound to come up. This unassuming haunt at 71st and Memorial—featuring a full bar and weekend live music—has been serving classic Thai cuisine to Tulsa since 1998.</p>
										<p>Menu highlights are numerous. Lanna Summer Rolls are full of fresh carrots, basil, romaine, and cilantro, and are wrapped in light rice paper. The Tom Kha Gai is a hearty chicken soup made tart with lemongrass, lime leaves and tamarind juice.
											And of course, there’s the famous Pad Thai and Pad See-lew. Lanna Thai’s spice level operates on a scale of 1-5, ranging from mild to holy shit.</p>

										<h2>Best Patio</h2>
										<h3>Blue Rose Cafe</h3>
										<p>After a storied existence on Brookside, Blue Rose Cafe reopened in 2011 at 19th and Riverside, offering cheap beer, reasonably priced food, live music, and, best of all, a kickass patio.</p>
										<p>Blue Rose promises classic, no-frills bar fare and boy, do they deliver: burgers, blackened chicken, cheese fries, and wings anchor the menu, but they also offer options for those craving a lighter, al fresco lunch on the waterfront, such as
											wraps, salads, and salmon.</p>
										<p>But, hands down, the crown jewel is its expansive, bi-level riverfront patio with a beautiful view of the sunset, making it a perfect choice for a quitting-time happy hour.</p>

										<p>You open your eyes, immediately regretting that last shot of bourbon. A train full of sledge hammers conducted by Tom Waits barrels through your head. You have a hunger.</p>
										<p>Brookside by Day—a Tulsa staple since 1991—offers the classic diner breakfast fare, from eggs benedict to breakfast pork chops, along with morning specials and a recently added bar. But, if you’re in more of a lunch mood, get your damn lips
											around a burger you big hung-over baby.</p>
										<p>The atmosphere is inviting, casual, and low-key. Don’t fret about your smeared mascara or the questionable choices you made the night before. BBD doesn’t judge. BBD just wants to help you.</p>

    						<p>Reasor’s Foods’ updated locations on Brookside, 41st and Yale, 15th and Lewis, and in Jenks, Broken Arrow, and Owasso were all redesigned and expanded to create a healthier, more fulfilling shopping experience.</p>
    						<p>By offering local Scissortail Farms’ leafy greens and a bevy of other locally grown and organic produce (as well as a stronger presence from other local and regional purveyors) the Oklahoma grocery chain has upped its game to compete with the handful
    							of health-minded but often prohibitively expensive markets that have sprung up across Tulsa.</p>
    						<p>Registered dieticians are available at five locations, offering services including weight loss advice and disease-related education. They’ll even give you a tour of the supermarket to show you wholesome options.</p>
    						<p>Other reasons to love Reasor’s: free lunch for military personnel on Veteran’s Day, an annual food drive, their decision to not carry genetically modified salmon, and the cheese island at the Brookside location that rivals that of its neighbor,

    							<p>At a time when new Italian concepts are cropping up in Tulsa left and right, the old school favorite, Ti Amo, has prevailed and nabbed Tulsa’s vote for best Italian. Maybe it’s an affinity for the old reliable; maybe it’s the free bruschetta. Either
    								way, the 25 year-old Ti Amo—with locations in south Tulsa at 61st and Sheridan and downtown at 2nd and Cheyenne—has remained a go-to for low-lit romantic ambiance and house-made Italian food.</p>
    							<p>Dedicated diners swear by the chicken piccatta, the chicken alfredo, the bone-in ribeye, and the shrimp and lobster bisque. All the entrees come with soup or salad, the aforementioned free bruschetta, and impeccable service from an attentive wait

    								traditional favorites like the seafood and vegetable pancake, kimchi pancake, bibimbap—a fresh vegetable, fried egg, and rice dish—served with banchan, kimchi fried rice, and stir-fried squid and pork.</p>

Bros. Houligan, a Tulsa establishment since 1987, clearly knows what it’s doing. Though it offers a variety of southern comfort food ranging from chicken tenders, fried Gulf shrimp and pork chops to grilled salmon, rainbow trout and several cuts of steak, it’s the gloriously gigantic chicken fried steak that has made it a Tulsa institution. The dinner comes with an embarrassment of sides including green beans, plus choices of mashed potatoes, French fries or waffle fries, and cottage cheese, coleslaw, salad or applesauce.</p>

    								<li><span>How long have you been a bartender?</span> About a decade. I started out at TGI Friday’s and trained there in 2002 or 2003. Good training back in the day. Not so much now. Corporate training is great, you take that corporate training and
    									take it somewhere private and you’ll make a lot more money.</li>
    								<li><span>What’s your drink of choice?</span> Whiskey on the rocks. Jameson is what I drink most. But I like so many others.</li>
    								<li><span>What do you think about the craft cocktail movement that’s hit Tulsa in the last several years?</span> Oh man, it’s fantastic. I’m glad people are getting into it. We’ve got a lot of new, fresh bartenders in the scene, people who are just crushin’ it
    									and killin’ it. Valkyrie, all those boys over there are just phenomenal at making cocktails. Mixco and Saturn Room, too. I’ve had some crazy shit at Saturn Room.</li>
    								<li><span>What’s the one thing a customer should never do when ordering a drink?</span> Wave you down, ask for your attention, then take five minutes to order because they’re not really sure. It’s one thing if they’ve got questions, but if they literally
    									just want you to stand in front of them while they tap on their face and go “Ummm…” Just don’t do that. I’m super, super busy and I’m going to give you my undivided attention, but don’t “Umm” me, ‘cuz that guy over there wants a drink, too.</li>
    								<li><span>What’s the key to being a good bartender?</span> For me, more than making the drinks, it’s about being there for your guests, making sure they’re having a positive experience. In turn, that positive experience bounces right back to you,
    									and you bounce it right back to someone else, and you start a perpetuation of kindness that goes across your bar. Our bar isn’t just a bar, it’s a community. We have lots of regulars who we call friends, most of whom are in my speed dial. It’s
    									about serving the community. We offer a place where you can go and you’ve got friends.</li>

                                    with a sixteenth opening later this year in Moore.</p>

    								<li><span>Which dish were you proudest to plate in 2015?</span> I was really proud of getting Ben Alexander acclimated at the Tavern, and really getting to do some fun Chef’s Tables with him. We did a really fun, tongue-in-cheek pho dish with Jeremy
    									Reed of the Saturn Room. It was a five-spice duck breast over crispy Brussels sprouts with a pho broth and enoki mushrooms. It had all the elements of pho, but it was also very un-pho-like too, and that’s kind of what we’ve been playing with
    									over there: taking familiar things, and presenting them in an unfamiliar fashion.
    									<br/>
    									<br/>And the chimichuri octopus ... Dude, that was so much fun. That’s probably my favorite. I’ve been doing it with squid too and it’s just as good. A friend of mine was in Mexico and sent me a picture of a whole grilled octopus, and I immediately
    									texted Ben and said, ‘we are doing this at Temp Tavern. Let’s do different menus, let’s change it up each week.’ It was so good and so simple, and kinda ballsy to throw a whole octopus on a plate. </li>
    								<li><span>What do you wish diners would quit asking for?</span> Sides of ranch. Side note: I love ranch. I keep a bottle of it at all times in my house. I’m as Oklahoma as the rest of us. </li>
    								<li><span>What’s your favorite restaurant in the world?</span> My favorite restaurant in the world is this little restaurant called La Becasse, and it’s on a lake in a small town in northern Michigan. Just unapologetically French. Sit outside, perfect
    									weather, duck confit, nice French wine. It’s great. I go there every time I’m up there—my family’s from Michigan. </li>
    								<li><span>Where do you send out-of-towners for dinner?</span> The Lounge, currently. Juniper, Tallgrass, SMOKE. Those are for special dinners. Then I have a host of dirty floor Mexican restaurants and Vietnamese joints.</li>
    								<li><span>What does Tulsa need more of?</span> Tulsa needs more people like your readers: more adventurous diners, more people willing to take chances on different food concepts.</li>

    						<p>As a throwback to the classic diners dotting the highways of the sixties and seventies, Dilly Diner (formerly Dilly Deli) does several things very well, not the least of them breakfast. It’s nearly impossible to snag a table without a wait on weekends,
    							and executive chef Trevor Tack’s menu injects new life into short-order classics by paying special attention to sourcing, pairing, and presentation. The menu favors the diner staples, but with a fresh, local twist: meals like green eggs and ham,
    							Griddle Cakes, French toast, fluffy biscuits and gravy, fat roadside-style cheeseburgers, and spicy chicken and waffles. And of course, pie—lots of it, served with dollops of “farm-to-cone” ice cream (made with Lomah dairy). Did we mention they
    							offer full bar service, with boozy drinks like the cereal milk cocktail? Dilly Diner is a true gem for downtown Tulsa, and it’s no surprise you selected it as your favorite new restaurant.</p>

						<h3>Woody Guthrie mural at Woody Guthrie Center</h3>
						<p>Woody Guthrie was a man of small stature, but his memory and music live on in a big way, especially in Tulsa. In the Brady District, his presence looms large on the west end of the Woody Guthrie Center where a large mural, painted by Clean Hands
							founder Aaron Whisner, depicts the iconic image of Guthrie playing a guitar adorned with the phrase “This Machine Kills Fascists.”</p>
						<p>Guthrie was an outspoken protestor of the rich elite whom he saw as responsible for the poor social and economic conditions working men endured. Earlier this year, Bernie Sanders, who preaches an updated version of the troubadour’s message, visited
							the mural and Center on his way to a campaign rally at the Cox Business Center.</p>
						<p>Besides the awesome painting on the building’s outside, the Woody Guthrie Center houses plenty of other delights: Woody’s actual guitar, his lyric journal, Dust Bowl exhibits, and a music bar. At only $8, it’s a low price to pay to get better acquainted
							with the patron saint of Oklahoma music.</p>

								<h3>Cry Baby Hill</h3>
								<p>Those who don’t know about Cry Baby Hill don’t know what they’re missing. Outrageous behavior by people clad in outrageous (and outrageously absent) costumes can be observed atop our city’s monument to mondo madness. A party at the final race
									of the Tulsa Tough cycling weekend, Cry Baby Hill has grown from just a few inspired idiots to a crowd of three thousand-plus. It has also become the day’s focal point, eclipsing most notions of the race. Aliens, cavemen, and every member of
									the Village People dance and drink while confused cyclists whiz by. DJs keep the party going, and refs keep the ragers in check. Those refs are in on the mania too, but if you want to keep barriers off the hill you better listen to them. And
									if this is the first time you’ve heard of CBH, just remember these words: MIND THE GAP.</p>

									Plains Music Festival, a hip-hop and jazz fest that brought together local favorites along with a headlining spot for Kendrick Lamar collaborator Thundercat. Most recently, the club co-hosted the music leg of Tulsa Overground Film &amp; Music

									<li><span>Do you remember the first song you wrote? </span> I started writing when I was about ten. All I can remember is that it was nonsense lyrics and a really simple guitar thing, very repetitive. But, I don’t actually remember how it went.
									</li>
									<li><span>Your lyrics feel more literary than most. As a writer, who are your biggest influences? </span> I don’t read a whole lot of books. I’m trying to make myself do more of that. But, I mostly read magazines and stuff on the Internet. So, it’s
										hard to cite literary influences. I just kind-of zone out and write what comes to me and make it fit where it sounds like it’s supposed to go in the song.
									</li>
									<li><span>How much of your writing is autobiographical, and how much is fictional or observational? </span> I mean it all starts out being autobiographical, and then sometimes—well, the lines get blurred a little. If something works better in a song,
										then it doesn’t have to be true for me to put it in. So, sometimes for musical purposes the truth will get stretched a little bit.
									</li>
									<li><span>Tell us about performing on Colbert.</span>  I was nervous going into it and then as soon as we got to the studio it kind of went away. Everyone was so accommodating and really good at their jobs. And, the theater isn’t as big as it looks
										on TV. Overall, it was a really good, pleasant experience. I think John Travolta complained about the music we were listening to in my green room. I think we were next to the makeup room and he was in there for makeup. We were listening to Ghostface
										Killah on my phone. My tour manager got a frantic call from someone at the show saying there was a complaint and we needed to turn it down.
									</li>
									<li><span>Are you a Tulsa lifer, or could you see yourself one day moving to an Austin or a Nashville for your career? </span> I have no interest in moving right now. I’m not going to make any predictions for the future, but right now I really like
										living somewhere that isn’t necessarily a music business town. It’s cool to be able to go to Nashville, or L.A., or wherever when there’s business to be taken care of, then be able to leave that bubble and come back to a real place. That’s really
										nice.</li>

								<h3>Broken Arrow Warren Theatre</h3>
								<p>Since its grand opening a little over a year ago, the Broken Arrow Warren Theatre has been drawing movie-lovers like flies to an art deco bug zapper. With a design aesthetic somewhere south of Olivia Newton-John’s disco musical, “Xanadu,” and
									a retro ‘50s diner ripped right out of “Happy Days,” it’s a lot like a vintage Wurlitzer jukebox that anachronistically plays CDs.</p>
								<p>The theater also packs a serious technical punch. When “The Force Awakens” came out last year, director JJ Abrams was adamant it be seen through laser projection with a Dolby Atmos 64-channel sound system. The Warren sports both with aplomb.</p>
								<p>Balcony seats, as well as the Director’s Suites, offer full food and bar service with themed drinks and a plethora of amped up diner fare, like a burger whose bun is replaced with two grilled cheese sandwiches. You can get it with cream gravy,
									which might be a perfect culinary metaphor for over-the-top summer blockbusters.</p>

								<h2><span>Five Questions with <strong>Calvin compton</strong> &amp; <strong>Jesse McNutt</strong> from starship records and tapes</span></h2>
								<ul>
									<li><span>What are three records everyone should be listening to? </span> Calvin Compton: David Bowie, Blackstar, definitely. The Gutter Villain EP which we have the CD of. An album everyone needs to hear is Glitter Wizard’s Hunting Gatherers. <em>Jesse McNutt: Calvin already said Glitter Wizard? Bastard! Two from this year, Borknagar’s Winter Thrice, and Abbath’s self-titled. And George Kollias, from Nile— you’ve gotta check out his solo album, Invictus.</em>
									</li>
									<li><span>How do you feel about Record Store Day? Is it still beneficial, or has it outgrown its use? </span> CC: It’s still beneficial, but you really have to know the audience you’re ordering for. You can’t just order everything and expect it to
										be bought up. What I think is hurting more [by backing up pressing plants] are the mail order subscription services like Vinyl Me, Please, and Edit, that do limited presses of albums that are already out. Every month.
									</li>
									<li><span>Have the backed up record plants affected your store? </span> CC: Oh yeah. There can be a record everyone is waiting for, and it can get pushed back three months. And not just around Record Store Day.
									</li>
									<li><span>So you’re a combination record store and head shop. What’s the most fried thing you’ve ever seen a customer do?</span> CC: Piss themselves while standing right in front of me. They just wanted us to play a Jimmy Smith song. <em>JM: Stand here

    							<p>To “learn something new” at Philbrook, all you need to do is visit the museum on the second Saturday of each month for free family-friendly art activities, join the My Museum club with your kids (each month, children receive a new art supply!),
    								attend the gallery talk every second Wednesday for talks on the collections and current exhibitions, or stop by on the third Thursday of each month for an evening of contemporary art discussion, cash bar, and light food.</p>
    							<p>Philbrook makes seeing, learning about, and enjoying art easy.</p>

						<p>A night on the lanes is about getting together and having fun, regardless of how many frames it’s been since you picked up a spare. The folks at the Dust Bowl clearly believe in this philosophy, as evidenced by the bank of arcade games, the laneside
							food-and-drink service, and those wonderful, springy, astro-turf covered stools on the patio.</p>
						<p>Best of all is the private room. Gloriously gaudy, with a marlin hanging on the wall and just wide enough for two lanes, it’ll make you feel like Nixon in the poster hanging over The Dude’s tiki bar. (Almost made it without a Lebowski reference.

								<p>Hidden in the basement of an old office building, the Cellar Dweller—with its red-lit ultra-70s aesthetic and Cheers-like collection of regulars—is the best worst-kept secret in downtown. Sometimes the live music packs enough people in the summer

								<p>The Lafayette Drillers moved to Tulsa in the late 70s. The minor league club long claimed a park at the fairgrounds as their home base before moving to ONEOK Field in 2010. If the sport itself isn’t your thing, you can still visit the park for
									baseball’s auxiliary aspects. You can get a bunch of ice cream inside of a helmet. You can watch people do a sack race during the 7th inning stretch. You can marvel at the DJ’s choice to play “yakkity-sax” right after a Skrillex track. Best of
									all, you can drink beer and eat hot dogs with your friends and family while watching the fireworks like a true ‘Merican.</p>

								<h2><span>Five Questions with <strong>Mike Wozniak</strong> of Soundpony</span></h2>
								<ul>
									<li><span style="display: inline;">When you opened Soundpony, did you imagine it would turn into the cultural epicenter it’s become for downtown Tulsa? </span> I think we always had a notion that we wanted it to serve the public and be a community spot. A lot of it has been shaped by the community that has surrounded it. I didn’t know what it was going to turn out to be ten years later. We liked art and music and bikes. And Tulsa. That’s genuinely the way we feel about things and that’s part of its appeal.</li>
										<li><span>What’s the strangest graffiti you’ve seen on the walls of your bathrooms?</span> Do you remember the great ice storm of, like, 2009? They had a huge pile of fallen branches at a park near the river. Someone put a graffiti tag in the bathroom that said “burn all them branches.” I thought that was kind of funny. A great number of penises have been drawn here, too. That’s the gateway drug to graffiti. We love it all here.</li>
										<li><span>How do you explain your win for “Best Nightclub”?</span> Well, at night … we have DJs. And we have a real open attitude towards how you want to dance. People feel free to express themselves here so the dance parties become pretty good.
											</li>
										<li><span>How did selfies in your ladies room become a thing?</span> Miley Cyrus took one while eating a hotdog and, after that, everyone wanted a piece. Yeah. From then on? Legend, kind of. </li>
										<li><span>Can you tell us a little about the work Soundpony has done to promote cycling in Tulsa?</span> Not to get on the grandstand, but we see other cities and how they’re progressing and it’s not necessarily towards a car-centric culture anymore.
											So much in Oklahoma that we battle against is in health and wellness. We do the Bike Club for youth and have our race teams. We’re just trying to elevate this town in terms of bike and pedestrian-related stuff. The bike is a beautiful piece
											of working art and Tulsa is easy to commute. It seems like an answer to a lot of our problems.</li>

								<h2><span>Five Questions with <strong>Shannon Easton-White</strong>, Program Manager for Guthrie Green</span></h2>

								<ul>
									<li><span>What do you look for in events and programs to bring to Guthrie Green?</span> Our core team and outside organizers attempt to have a truly collaborative effort to bring diversity in programming to the park every season. From food festivals,
										fitness programs, educational elements, movies, concerts, and more…there is an endless road of ideas. Organizations are encouraged to present their own events at Guthrie Green, and can start the process by simply filling out an online event
										proposal form on the website.</li>

									<li><span>This may be impossible to answer, but if you can narrow it down, what was your personal favorite day at Guthrie Green last year?</span> Honestly, every day I am there is a favorite day. Let me pick two days from the 2015 season. Oysterfest
										will always be a favorite! And KIDS DAY. Our first June in 2013, we decided to do something for the kids while most of Tulsa was celebrating at Tulsa Tough’s Crybaby Hill. This event continues to exceed all of my expectations. </li>

									<li><span>What’s one of your favorite regularly occurring Guthrie Green events?</span> I love our movie in the park series on Thursday nights (May-October). We have worked with sponsors to provide some themed movie nights and these really take it
										to the next level. Some have included a band beforehand, playing era or genre specific music in line with the film, costume contests, or even themed drinks and food at Lucky’s on the Green. </li>

									<li><span>Guthrie Green won one of our new categories this year, Best Place for a Tinder Date. What do you think makes Guthrie Green such a good place to meet a match?</span> I love that Guthrie Green can serve as a central meeting place for friends,
										families, and yes, even Tinder dates…The location of the park is walkable to many different downtown districts and if there is not something programmed at Guthrie Green, there is probably something going on near the park.</li>

									<li><span>Anything you’re working on for this year you’re particularly excited about or would like to do at the Green sometime in the future?</span> Every day is a learning experience and it helps keep our team on the edge of our seats. What’s next?
										We have had opportunities to branch out from Guthrie Green with the same type of mission and produce festivals with our friends, which include Blue Whale Comedy Festival, Tulsa Overground Film &amp; Music, and XPO Gaming Convention. I would
										say that I am excited about what is to come with these festivals as they grow in 2016! As for the block radius of Guthrie Green, the season is jam packed with fun. Our Sunday concerts will see a change this season with adding new presenters:
										TulsaJazz.com, KOSU, and La Semana Newspaper. I am looking forward to seeing the bands and activities they have planned for you on Sunday afternoons!</li>

								<h3>The Brady Arts District</h3>
								<p>Not long ago, there was little more than a few shining beacons in what’s now known as the Brady Arts District: Cain’s, Caz’s, Gypsy Coffee House. Now you’ll find in it the beating heart of the city. No other area of town illustrates so clearly
									just how much Tulsa has grown in such a short period of time.</p>
								<p>That the other two finalists for this category are within The Brady Arts District says it all. Furthermore, you’ll find places in the district as finalists in over a third of all the BOT categories.</p>
								<p>One thing we take issue with—The Brady Arts District showing up as a finalist for Best Place to Feel Like You’re Not In Tulsa. Seriously? <em>The Brady Arts District is Tulsa.</em> Welcome.</p>

								<h2><span>Five Questions with <strong>Travis Meyer</strong> of News on 6</span></h2>
								<ul>
									<li><span>I understand you’re a rancher. How does your interest in weather intersect with ranching?</span>Your whole life as a rancher revolves around the weather. You’re involved in the weather, the weather’s involved in your life. It’s kind of
										like how I was as a kid. So many meteorologists are geared toward TV living because they grew up in a city, and I grew up on a farm. So I kind of have a different perspective.
									</li>
									<li><span>What sort of natural disasters should Oklahomans be most worried about?</span>Obviously, there’s a natural tendency to have more tornados [here] than any other place in the country—or in the world, really … It’s been horrible in Joplin,
										it’s been horrible in Oklahoma City. And [Tulsa has] prevailed—knock on wood—without something horrible happening here. But it’s just statistically a matter of time before something not great happens here. (Editor’s note: A few days after this
										interview, a tornado touched down in Tulsa, causing damage and injuries.)
									</li>
									<li><span>What’s your take on human-induced climate change?</span>You can’t have billions of people running around in cars and tearing down forests and changing the way that nature had it balanced without knocking it out of balance. When people put
										it in perspective, yes, it’s a state of flux, yes, things are happening, and yes, I do believe we have an impact on that, but instead of screaming bloody murder and making it a religion, let’s just look at it, learn from it, and try to help
										future generations.
									</li>
									<li><span>Do people get pissed off when you have to pre-empt football games or other sporting events? Any particularly juicy pieces of vitriol that anyone sent you?</span> [Meyer reads the following letter to me, which has been edited for brevity]:
										“Travis, did your mom not hug you enough when you were a kid? Are you an attention freak? I bet you’re a prima donna … Say what you have to say, then shut the hell up! You do this crap every time there’s a dark cloud or a breeze messes up your
										hair—what hair you have left. Get some help, man. Find the lord, collect stamps, for God’s sake, quit being a camera freak!”
									</li>
									<li><span>What is the most interesting cloud shape you’ve ever seen?</span> [It] looked like a flying saucer over my small town in Nebraska where I grew up. It produced a tornado and had baseball-sized hail in it … I didn’t know enough about the
										weather to really be scared. It was kind of my epiphany.</li>

								<h2><span><strong>Trolling Tulsa is a $30 citation.</strong><br/> An interview with LaRoy Parks, City of Tulsa Parking Enforcer</span></h2>
								<ul>
									<li><span>How did you become a meter maid?</span> My father was a parking enforcement officer during World War II in Berlin. He was brought over to America after the war during Operation Paperclip because he shared the same name as a nuclear physicist.
										He instilled into me at an early age that parking correctly was the backbone of civilization, and to never cut any slack to the sub-humans that refuse to park correctly.</li>
									<li><span>You beat out some very respectable Tulsans for best person to follow on social media. Yet, your Twitter and Facebook accounts are less than two months old. Why do you think you’ve become so popular so quickly?</span> This is the year of
										the outsider, my friend. You have men like our future president Donald J. Trump that have shown we don’t need to be told who to listen to anymore. You even have a communist libra named Bernie Sanders who seems to be straight out of North Crimea
										who has brought his message of stealing from others and smoking jazz cigarettes into the mainstream. I think the main reason that the social media accounts have gained such traction is because the people fear me and my power. There is no worse
										feeling in the world than finding one of my tickets under your windshield wiper!</li>
									<li><span>There are rumors you’re an impostor who doesn’t actually work for the city. How do you respond to that?</span> With a $30 citation.</li>
									<li><span>What can you tell us about your bromance with Blake Ewing?</span>  I once was lost, but now am found. Blake Ewing has truly made Tulsa great again. The man earned my respect by engaging with citizens on my comment threads, answering their
										questions directly and as best as he could. I’m just glad that I was the one who provided the forum for Tulsans to speak with him, when they otherwise wouldn’t have said anything. I stir up courage in the sheeple &ndash; er &ndash; people. And
										plus, he isn’t a damn ol DEMONcrat. Oh yeah, he’s a good cuddler too.</li>
									<li><span>You support Donald Trump for President but have been actively campaigning against Vic Regalado for Tulsa Sheriff. What could Regalado learn from Trump?</span> Well, the things mister Regalado did while in uniform at the TPD are illegal
										in other states like Ohio. Mister Trump has never, and would never, offend the people of Ohio like Regalado has, even though that ugly boy Kasich won the primaries there. Just think to yourself, would I elect a person that has violated Ohio
										law? The only thing Regalado can learn from Trump at this point is how to grow and maintain a decent hairstyle.</li>
									<li><span>What’s your relationship like with American Parking? Competitive or friendly?</span>  I was just fine co-existing with them until they left me hate mail on my website Tulsa-Parking.com. That was a low down dirty thing they did, so I suppose
										the gloves are off at this point.</li>
									<li><span>Be honest, where does all that parking ticket money go?</span> This interview is over.</li>

    							<p>No surprises here, folks. The beloved bevy of bok choy, berry, and puffy taco-touting vendors at the Cherry Street Farmers’ Market has earned Tulsans’ approval as the best of its kind in town. The honor is well-deserved: the market is one of the
    								few places in Tulsa-proper where you can consistently find locally-grown, picked, pickled, and plated foods from small businesses and farmers.</p>
    							<p> The prices don’t hurt, either. While most think purchasing locally sourced and/or organic food is unaffordable, the Cherry Street Farmers’ Market is actively changing that rhetoric with competitive bundles and bulk pricing.</p>
    							<p> Regardless of the produce cost, the value of engaging directly with the farmers is priceless. A handshake and two cents from the person who grew your food is so much more meaningful than the “paper or plastic” ask at the end of the grocery store
    								conveyor belt.</p>
    							<p> Live tunes from local singer-songwriters, a walkable festival-type environment, kid-friendly vibes, and a generous SNAP benefit program are just a few of the many things that make Cherry Street Farmers’ Market a Tulsa institution.</p>
